# Linux File Structure Practice

This project is a hands-on exercise in working with basic Linux file commands: `touch`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`.

## Structure

- `notes/`: Contains text files with daily notes
- `scripts/`: Contains simple bash scripts
- `archive/`: Ignored folder for backups/logs

## Goal

Learn and practice file manipulation in a real Linux environment and push to GitHub.
